This data will just include 2013 to 2022 of Alameda and santaclara counties, it will also just include the road and crash features then add weather data. Traffic will not be included as this is a test and we want to study the features of the road not the features of the traffic distribution.

Todo:

[] append weather data

[] create the dataset used for testing models

[] create plots to show the data distributions
